parser.rb:
	Composable parsers.
	Auto-generate as much of the AST as possible, including AST node classes.
	Add a simple way to lexically scope the language.
	Add a way of setting a default lexer for a parser.
	Allow a parser to accept strings as an input (and take a lexer as an argument).
	Allow the parser to parse one token at a time (thus allowing the lexer to be changed in the middle of parsing).
	Allow the first argument to the associativity methods to be a integer to be used as the value for those tokens.  An error should be raised if associativity values are given in a non-increasing order.
	Get token associativity information to line up in explain.
	
lexer.rb:
	Composable lexers.

ast.rb:
	Investigate a better way of storing name and type information for values and children, as well as better ways to define the accessors.

cfg.rb
	Add the ability to print out grammars in a textual form.

tokens.rb:

Code generation:
	Figure out what an AssemblyAnnotationWriter is and what it is used for.
	Add ability to set tail call info on call instructions.

Semantics:
	Fill in the remaining semantic tools:
		* Actor
		* Axiomatic
		* Big-Step Operational
		* Denotational
		* Hoare Logic
		* Join Calculus
		* Lambda Calculus
		* Operational
		* Pi Calculus
		* Small-Step Operational
	
	Add the ability to translate between different semantics.

Misc:
	Convert to Ruby 1.9 syntax. (PARTIAL)
	Update the documentation to use the @overloaded tag.
